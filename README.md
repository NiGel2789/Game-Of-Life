## Getting Started

Welcome to my Game of Life remake, powered by Java and Swing for CSE 563 at Arizona State University.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Running the application
Please pull all files into a local directory, and run the file App.java within your environement.

## In the app
Click on squares to color / uncolor them as you wish. Once you have a pattern that you are satisfied with, click on the Start button to begin going through generations.
Because of constraints with Java Swing and Java, we are only able to show 999 iterations per pattern (if needed).
Once the board is filled with only unpopulated spaces, the algorithm will stop automatically.
The rules of the game are in the 'Explanation' button.
The 'Clear' button clears the grid.
The 'Next' button iterates through the generations one by one.
